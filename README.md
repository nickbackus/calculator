# Calculator App
This is a basic calculator web app built with React & Bootstrap.

## Features

- Buttons can be clicked or input from your keyboard can be typed directly into the calculator
- Flexible layout designed for use on all different devices

## Installation 
Clone or download the project from its [Github repository](https://github.com/nickbackus/calculator)

In the project directory you can do the following:

### `npm install`
Installs all of the dependencies. Run this first before trying to run the application.

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
